# â™Ÿ WintrChess

A website built to analyse your Chess games and provide useful studying tools, free of charge.

Originally [Game Report](https://github.com/wintrcat/freechess), the platform has been rebuilt with vastly more features.

# ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The WintrChess repository is a monorepo made up of three packages:

#### `client`
The frontend for the website built with React and TypeScript.

#### `server`
The backend for the website where the website content is served, and where any API endpoints will live.

#### `shared`
Libraries, types and common logic is stored here and can be accessed by both the frontend and backend.
